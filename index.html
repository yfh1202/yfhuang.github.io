Introduction

Yu-Feng Huang is currently working in the Dr. Kuo-Ping Chiu’s research group at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Yu-Feng received his PhD in 2010 from the Department of computer science and information engineering/National Taiwan University, working on the prediction of protein binding residues. After graduation, I worked with my thesis advisor as the postdoc and continued research topics on protein binding site prediction with different targets including DNA and RNA. In 2011, I joined the Dr. Kuo-Ping Chiu’s laboratory as the postdoc at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. In 2021, I moved to TOP science biotechnologies Inc. found by Dr. Kuo-Ping Chiu, as a researcher.
